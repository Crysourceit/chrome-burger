![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

The entire project is self-contained in a single `index.html` file. Here's a breakdown of the technologies:

*   **HTML:** The core structure of the website is built using semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).

*   **CSS:** All styling is contained within a `<style>` block in the `<head>`. It includes:
    *   **CSS Variables:** For easy theme management (e.g., colors for light and dark modes).
    *   **Flexbox:** For layout and alignment of components.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Media queries ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   **Animations:** Subtle CSS keyframe animations for a more dynamic feel.

*   **JavaScript:** All interactivity is handled by vanilla JavaScript within a `<script>` block. The scripts are responsible for:
    *   **Mobile Navigation:** Toggling the navigation menu on smaller screens.
    *   **Theme Switcher:** A light/dark mode toggle that saves the user's preference.
    *   **Menu Carousel:** An infinite-scrolling carousel for the menu items.
